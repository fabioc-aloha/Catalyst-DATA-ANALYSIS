## Abstract

This study examines relationships between building age, customer satisfaction, and return on investment across 869 retail electronics stores using Pearson correlation analysis. Results reveal a strong positive correlation between customer satisfaction and ROI (r = 0.637), explaining 40.6% of financial performance variance. Building age demonstrates opposing effects: positive correlation with customer satisfaction (r = 0.274) but negative correlation with ROI (r = -0.193). These findings support customer experience investments while highlighting facility management trade-offs. The analysis also demonstrates methodological limitations of correlation approaches for survey-based doctoral research, supporting the adoption of Structural Equation Modeling for complex organizational studies with non-normal Likert scale data.

## Introduction

Correlation analysis serves as a fundamental statistical technique for understanding relationships between continuous variables in business research (Field, 2018). In the retail electronics industry, understanding the interrelationships between operational metrics such as customer satisfaction, financial performance, and facility characteristics is crucial for strategic decision-making (Anderson & Sullivan, 1993; Fornell et al., 1996). Research has consistently demonstrated that customer satisfaction metrics serve as key predictors of financial performance across various retail contexts (Gupta & Zeithaml, 2006; Kumar et al., 2010).

This analysis investigates the correlations between three key performance indicators across 869 retail locations: building age (BLDGAGE), customer satisfaction scores (CUSTSCORE), and return on investment scores (ROISCORE). Understanding these relationships is particularly important in the retail electronics sector, where rapid technological changes and evolving consumer preferences create complex operational challenges (Grewal et al., 2017).

### Research Hypotheses

Based on service-profit chain theory and facility management literature, three specific hypotheses guide this analysis:

**H1:** Customer satisfaction scores will demonstrate a positive correlation with return on investment scores, supporting the service-profit chain model that links customer experience to financial performance (Heskett et al., 1994).

**H2:** Building age will demonstrate a negative correlation with customer satisfaction scores, as newer facilities typically provide enhanced customer experiences through modern amenities and layouts (Jones et al., 2010).

**H3:** Building age will demonstrate a negative correlation with return on investment scores, as newer facilities offer operational efficiencies that translate to better financial performance (Rondeau et al., 2012).

These hypotheses will be tested through Pearson correlation analysis to quantify relationship strength and direction, informing operational strategies and facility management decisions.

## Methodology

### Data Source and Variables

The analysis utilized data from 869 retail electronics stores with three continuous variables:

- **BLDGAGE**: Building age in years (continuous scale variable)
- **CUSTSCORE**: Customer satisfaction score ranging from 1-100 (continuous scale variable)
- **ROISCORE**: Return on investment score ranging from 1-100 (continuous scale variable)

### Statistical Analysis

Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated using SPSS-equivalent procedures in Python with the pyreadstat library for metadata preservation (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2019). The correlation matrix examined all pairwise relationships between the three variables. Pearson correlation is appropriate for continuous variables that meet assumptions of linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity (Hair et al., 2019). Correlation coefficients were interpreted using Cohen's (1988) guidelines:

- Small effect: r = 0.10 to 0.29
- Medium effect: r = 0.30 to 0.49
- Large effect: r = 0.50 to 1.0

Statistical significance was evaluated at Î± = 0.05, with effect sizes reported regardless of statistical significance to address the distinction between statistical and practical significance (Sullivan & Feinn, 2012).

## Results

### Pearson Correlation Matrix

The correlation analysis yielded the following results:

**Table 1: Pearson Correlation Matrix**

|           | BLDGAGE | CUSTSCORE | ROISCORE |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| BLDGAGE   | 1.000   | 0.274     | -0.193   |
| CUSTSCORE | 0.274   | 1.000     | 0.637    |
| ROISCORE  | -0.193  | 0.637     | 1.000    |

**Note:** All correlations significant at p < 0.001 level (N = 869)

### Key Findings

1. **Customer Satisfaction-ROI (r = 0.637)**: Strong positive correlation supports H1, confirming that stores with higher customer satisfaction achieve better financial performance, validating service-profit chain theory (Heskett et al., 1994; Rust & Zahorik, 1993).

2. **Building Age-Customer Satisfaction (r = 0.274)**: Weak positive correlation contradicts H2, suggesting established locations may benefit from familiarity or renovations rather than newer facilities driving satisfaction (Jones et al., 2010).

3. **Building Age-ROI (r = -0.193)**: Weak negative correlation supports H3, confirming that newer buildings achieve better financial performance through modern efficiency features (Rondeau et al., 2012).

## Statistical Interpretation

The customer satisfaction-ROI correlation (r = 0.637) supports service-profit chain theory, with customer satisfaction explaining 40.6% of ROI variance (Heskett et al., 1994; Szymanski & Henard, 2001). Building age creates a strategic tension: established locations benefit customer satisfaction while newer facilities optimize operational efficiency (Bitner, 1992; Nourse & Roulac, 1993). This pattern suggests facility management requires balanced approaches considering both customer experience and operational performance (Baron & Kenny, 1986).

## Application to Doctoral Research

While Pearson correlation provides valuable insights for continuous variables, doctoral research requires more robust approaches due to critical limitations:

**Likert Scale Issues:** 5-point Likert scales violate normality assumptions through ceiling/floor effects and ordinal properties, creating biased correlation estimates (Norman, 2010; Jamieson, 2004; Rhemtulla et al., 2012).

**Multicollinearity Concerns:** Organizational research involves intercorrelated constructs that compromise pairwise correlation interpretability and create unstable parameter estimates (Kline, 2016; Podsakoff et al., 2003).

### Structural Equation Modeling for Doctoral Research

My doctoral research will employ SEM to address correlation analysis limitations:

**Key SEM Advantages:**
- Handles non-normal 5-point Likert data through robust estimators (MLR, WLSMV) (Finney & DiStefano, 2013; Li, 2016)
- Models latent constructs while accounting for measurement error (Kline, 2016)
- Tests complex relationships including mediation and moderation effects (Byrne, 2016)
- Provides comprehensive model fit evaluation (CFI, TLI, RMSEA) (Hu & Bentler, 1999)

**Technical Solutions:**
- Polychoric correlations for categorical data (Flora & Curran, 2004)
- Robust standard errors for normality violations (Satorra & Bentler, 2001)
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for distribution-free inference (Nevitt & Hancock, 2001)

## Conclusion

This correlation analysis of 869 retail electronics stores reveals three key relationships with distinct practical and methodological implications.

H1 was strongly supported: customer satisfaction and ROI demonstrate a robust positive correlation (r = 0.637), providing clear evidence for customer experience investments. H2 was rejected: building age shows a positive rather than negative correlation with customer satisfaction (r = 0.274), suggesting established location benefits outweigh modernization advantages. H3 was supported: building age negatively correlates with ROI (r = -0.193), confirming newer facility operational advantages.

For doctoral research, these findings highlight correlation analysis limitations with Likert scale data, supporting the adoption of Structural Equation Modeling for complex organizational studies. The methodological progression from correlation to SEM represents best practice for handling non-normal survey data while enabling comprehensive model evaluation.

These results provide evidence-based guidance for retail facility management and demonstrate the value of correlation analysis as a foundation for advanced statistical approaches in business research.
