# SPSS Integration and Advanced Statistical Analysis Requirements
# For comprehensive SPSS-to-Python transition and SEM capabilities
# Generated: July 24, 2025
# Requires: pip install -r requirements.txt (install core first)
# Requires: pip install -r requirements-analysis.txt (install advanced analytics first)

# Core SPSS Integration (SPSS-specific only)
pyreadstat>=1.2.0           # SPSS file reading with metadata preservation (PRIMARY)
# savReaderWriter>=3.4.0    # DISABLED: Python 3.11 collections compatibility issue
# Alternative: Use pyreadstat (more reliable) or install savReaderWriter manually if needed
# For SPSS file operations: pyreadstat handles .sav, .zsav, .por files with full metadata

# Statistical Reliability Analysis (Basic)
weightedcalcs>=0.1.3  # Weighted statistics calculations

# Note: Advanced reliability analysis (reliability package) moved to requirements-advanced.txt
# Note: This avoids numpy version conflicts with core scientific stack

# Database Connectivity (for enterprise SPSS workflows - SPSS-specific databases)
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0      # PostgreSQL connectivity (enterprise SPSS backend)
pymssql>=2.2.0              # SQL Server connectivity (enterprise SPSS backend)

# Large Dataset Processing (SPSS replacement for big data)
dask>=2023.7.0              # Parallel computing for large SPSS datasets

# Note: Environment variables (python-dotenv) are in requirements.txt
# Note: Core libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn) are in requirements.txt
# Note: Advanced analytics (pingouin, factor-analyzer, xgboost, lightgbm, plotly, dash, etc.) are in requirements-analysis.txt
# Note: Jupyter environment (jupyter, jupyterlab, ipywidgets, ipython) is in requirements.txt
# Note: Testing and development tools are in requirements-dev.txt
# Note: Documentation tools (sphinx, nbconvert, papermill) are in requirements-dev.txt

# To install complete SPSS replacement environment:
# 1. pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. pip install -r requirements-analysis.txt  
# 3. pip install -r requirements-SPSS.txt
# 4. pip install -r requirements-dev.txt (optional, for development)

# Optional Advanced Features (install as needed)
# tensorflow>=2.13.0        # Deep learning for advanced modeling
# torch>=2.0.0              # Alternative deep learning framework
# shap>=0.42.0              # Model explainability
# lime>=0.2.0               # Local interpretable model explanations
