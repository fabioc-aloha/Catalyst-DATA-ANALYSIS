# Advanced Statistical Computing and Bayesian Analysis Requirements
# For specialized statistical modeling and reliability analysis
# Generated: July 24, 2025
# Install AFTER core requirements but can be installed independently
# Handles packages with complex dependency chains

# Bayesian Analysis and Statistical Computing
pymc>=5.0.0                 # Bayesian modeling and probabilistic programming
arviz>=0.15.0               # Bayesian analysis and visualization
pytensor>=2.31.0            # Backend for PyMC (handles numba compatibility)

# Structural Equation Modeling
semopy>=2.3.0               # SEM modeling and analysis (with sklearn compatibility)

# Statistical Reliability Analysis
reliability>=0.9.0          # Reliability analysis, Weibull distributions, survival analysis
autograd>=1.7.0             # Automatic differentiation (reliability dependency)

# High-Performance Computing for Advanced Analytics
numba>=0.61.0               # JIT compilation for numerical functions
llvmlite>=0.44.0            # LLVM bindings for numba

# Advanced Statistical Methods
scikit-survival>=0.22.0     # Survival analysis
# lifelines>=0.27.0         # DISABLED: Python 3.11 compatibility issues
# scipy-optimize>=1.0.0     # REMOVED: Part of scipy core (already in requirements.txt)

# Note: For survival analysis, use scikit-survival or scipy.stats
# Note: lifelines can be installed manually if Python 3.11 support is added

# Note: This file contains packages with complex dependency chains
# Note: Install order matters - some packages may require specific numpy versions
# Note: If conflicts arise, install packages individually in order listed
# Note: Compatible with numpy>=1.24.0,<2.3.0 range for maximum compatibility

# Installation sequence for complex dependencies:
# 1. pip install -r requirements.txt (core foundation)
# 2. pip install -r requirements-analysis.txt (standard analytics)  
# 3. pip install -r requirements-SPSS.txt (SPSS integration)
# 4. pip install -r requirements-advanced.txt (this file - complex dependencies)
# 5. pip install -r requirements-dev.txt (development tools)

# Alternative installation (if conflicts occur):
# pip install pymc arviz semopy reliability --no-deps
# Then manually install missing dependencies as needed
