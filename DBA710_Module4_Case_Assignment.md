## Introduction

Customer satisfaction serves as a critical performance indicator in the retail industry, directly influencing customer retention, profitability, and competitive advantage (Anderson & Mittal, 2000). In the increasingly competitive retail electronics market, understanding the factors that drive customer satisfaction and identifying operational strategies that enhance customer experience outcomes has become essential for sustainable business success (Kumar & Reinartz, 2016).

This comprehensive statistical analysis examines customer satisfaction data from a large retail electronics chain operating 869 stores across six states (Arizona, California, Indiana, Missouri, Texas, and Washington). The organization employs both corporate-owned and franchise business models, providing an opportunity to investigate how ownership structure influences customer satisfaction outcomes (Bitner et al., 2021). Additionally, the geographic distribution of stores enables analysis of regional variations in customer experience performance (Porter, 2008).

The primary objective of this research is to conduct rigorous statistical analyses to identify significant relationships and differences in customer satisfaction across various operational and geographic dimensions (Field, 2018). Specifically, this study addresses three fundamental research questions: (1) Does ownership structure (corporate versus franchise) significantly influence customer satisfaction scores? (2) What relationships exist between operational metrics (ROI performance and facility age) and customer satisfaction outcomes? (3) Do customer satisfaction scores vary significantly across different geographic regions?

**Thesis Statement:** Statistical analysis of customer satisfaction data from a multi-state retail electronics chain reveals significant differences in customer experience outcomes based on ownership structure and geographic location, while demonstrating meaningful correlations between operational performance metrics and customer satisfaction scores, providing actionable insights for strategic business optimization.

The following sections present three distinct statistical analyses, each addressing specific research hypotheses through appropriate statistical methodologies (Maxwell et al., 2018). Results are presented in American Psychological Association (APA) format with comprehensive interpretation of practical business significance alongside statistical findings.

## Independent Samples T-Test: Corporate vs. Franchise Customer Satisfaction

### Research Question
To what extent does ownership structure (corporate versus franchise) influence customer satisfaction scores in retail electronics stores?

### Hypotheses
**H₀ (Null Hypothesis):** There is no statistically significant difference in customer satisfaction scores between corporate-owned stores and franchise-owned stores.

**H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):** There is a statistically significant difference in customer satisfaction scores between corporate-owned stores and franchise-owned stores.

### Statistical Analysis
An independent samples t-test was conducted to examine differences in customer satisfaction scores between corporate-owned stores (n = 434) and franchise-owned stores (n = 435) (Field, 2018). Prior to analysis, assumptions were evaluated: Levene's test for equality of variances was statistically significant, F = 4.89, p = 0.027, indicating heterogeneity of variance; therefore, equal variances were not assumed in the t-test calculation (Stevens, 2016).

### Results
An independent samples t-test revealed a statistically significant difference in customer satisfaction scores between corporate-owned stores and franchise-owned stores, with t(867) = 2.696, p = 0.007. The effect size was small to medium based on the practical significance of the difference. Corporate-owned stores demonstrated significantly higher customer satisfaction scores than franchise-owned stores. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis.

### Business Interpretation
The statistically significant difference in customer satisfaction scores between corporate and franchise stores, while statistically meaningful, represents a modest practical difference in the business context (Kirk, 2013). This finding suggests that corporate ownership structure may provide certain operational advantages that translate to enhanced customer experiences, potentially through standardized training protocols, consistent operational procedures, or improved resource allocation (Heskett et al., 2008). However, the small to medium effect size indicates that ownership structure accounts for only a limited portion of the variance in customer satisfaction outcomes, suggesting that other factors may be equally or more important in driving customer experience excellence (Cohen, 1988).

## Pearson Correlation Analysis: Operational Metrics and Customer Satisfaction

### Research Question
What relationships exist between operational performance metrics (ROI scores and building age) and customer satisfaction outcomes in retail electronics stores?

### Hypotheses
**H₀ (Null Hypothesis):** There are no statistically significant correlations between operational metrics (ROI scores and building age) and customer satisfaction scores.

**H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):** There are statistically significant correlations between operational metrics (ROI scores and building age) and customer satisfaction scores.

### Statistical Analysis
Pearson product-moment correlations were calculated to examine relationships between customer satisfaction scores and two operational variables: ROI performance scores and building age (in years) (Field, 2018). Assumptions of linearity and normality were assessed through scatterplot examination and normality testing (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2019). The dataset included complete cases for all 869 store locations.

### Results
**ROI Performance and Customer Satisfaction:** A Pearson correlation revealed a statistically significant strong positive relationship between ROI performance scores and customer satisfaction scores, r(867) = 0.637, p < 0.001. The 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient was (0.580, 0.688). This correlation indicates that approximately 40.6% of the variance in customer satisfaction scores is associated with ROI performance outcomes.

**Building Age and Customer Satisfaction:** A Pearson correlation revealed a statistically significant moderate positive relationship between building age and customer satisfaction scores, r(867) = 0.274, p < 0.001. The 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient was (0.208, 0.338). This correlation indicates that approximately 7.5% of the variance in customer satisfaction scores is associated with building age.

**ROI Performance and Building Age:** A Pearson correlation revealed a statistically significant moderate negative relationship between ROI performance scores and building age, r(867) = -0.193, p < 0.001, indicating that newer facilities tend to achieve higher ROI performance.

Hence, we reject the null hypothesis for all three correlation relationships.

### Business Interpretation
The strong positive correlation (r = 0.637) between ROI performance and customer satisfaction demonstrates a fundamental business truth: operational excellence directly translates to enhanced customer experiences (Anderson et al., 2019). This finding suggests that investments in operational efficiency, cost management, and revenue optimization create measurable improvements in customer satisfaction outcomes (Kumar & Reinartz, 2016). The moderate positive correlation between building age and customer satisfaction (r = 0.274) indicates that newer facilities contribute meaningfully to customer experience quality, likely through improved technology, layout design, and aesthetic appeal (Zeithaml et al., 2020). The negative correlation between ROI and building age suggests that facility modernization represents a strategic investment opportunity, potentially generating both operational efficiency gains and customer satisfaction improvements simultaneously (Fornell et al., 2016).

## One-Way Analysis of Variance: Regional Customer Satisfaction Differences

### Research Question
Do customer satisfaction scores vary significantly across different geographic regions (states) in the retail electronics chain?

### Hypotheses
**H₀ (Null Hypothesis):** There are no statistically significant differences in customer satisfaction scores across the six states (Arizona, California, Indiana, Missouri, Texas, Washington).

**H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):** There are statistically significant differences in customer satisfaction scores across the six states.

### Statistical Analysis
A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine differences in customer satisfaction scores across six states (Maxwell et al., 2018). The independent variable was STATE (categorical with six levels), and the dependent variable was CUSTSCORE (continuous). Sample sizes ranged from 118 stores (Washington) to 194 stores (California), with a total sample of 869 stores. Levene's test indicated heterogeneity of variance (F = 5.347, p < 0.001); however, ANOVA is robust to this violation given the large sample sizes (Field, 2018; Stevens, 2016). Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) post-hoc testing was conducted to identify specific pairwise differences.

### Results
The one-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in customer satisfaction scores between states, F(5, 863) = 8.550, p < 0.001, η² = 0.047. This represents a medium effect size according to Cohen's conventions (Cohen, 1988), indicating that approximately 4.7% of the variance in customer satisfaction is attributable to state differences.

**Descriptive Statistics by State:**
- Arizona: M = 26.00, SD = 4.29, n = 176
- California: M = 25.62, SD = 3.67, n = 194
- Indiana: M = 23.28, SD = 3.94, n = 124
- Missouri: M = 25.05, SD = 4.26, n = 128
- Texas: M = 24.61, SD = 2.77, n = 129
- Washington: M = 24.94, SD = 3.97, n = 118

**Post-Hoc Analysis Results:** LSD post-hoc testing identified nine statistically significant pairwise differences (p < 0.05). Arizona demonstrated the highest customer satisfaction scores, significantly outperforming Indiana (mean difference = 2.72, p < 0.001), Missouri (mean difference = 0.95, p = 0.035), Texas (mean difference = 1.40, p = 0.002), and Washington (mean difference = 1.06, p = 0.021). California also significantly outperformed Indiana (mean difference = 2.34, p < 0.001) and Texas (mean difference = 1.02, p = 0.020). Indiana consistently demonstrated the lowest performance, scoring significantly below all other states.

Hence, we reject the null hypothesis.

### Business Interpretation
The statistically significant regional differences in customer satisfaction reveal important geographic variations in operational performance (Homburg et al., 2017). Arizona's superior performance (M = 26.00) establishes a concrete benchmark for identifying and replicating successful operational practices across the organization (Porter, 2008). Indiana's consistently lower performance (M = 23.28) represents a critical improvement opportunity, suggesting systematic operational challenges that require targeted interventions (Reichheld & Sasser, 1990). The 2.72-point difference between Arizona and Indiana, while representing a medium statistical effect size, translates to meaningful business impact in customer experience delivery (Kirk, 2013). These findings support implementing differentiated regional strategies rather than uniform approaches across all locations, with particular emphasis on investigating Arizona's success factors and addressing Indiana's performance deficiencies (Mittal & Kamakura, 2001).

## Discussion and Business Insights

The comprehensive statistical analysis reveals several interconnected findings that provide actionable insights for strategic business optimization. The convergence of results across multiple analytical approaches strengthens confidence in the practical significance of these findings and their applicability to real-world business decision-making.

### Integrated Findings Analysis

The three statistical analyses demonstrate complementary relationships that collectively paint a comprehensive picture of customer satisfaction drivers within the retail electronics chain. The strong correlation between ROI performance and customer satisfaction (r = 0.637) provides the foundational understanding that operational excellence directly translates to customer experience outcomes. This relationship is further contextualized by the ownership structure analysis, which reveals that corporate-owned stores achieve marginally higher customer satisfaction scores, potentially through more standardized operational protocols that enhance both efficiency and customer experience.

The regional ANOVA results add a crucial geographic dimension to these findings, demonstrating that location-specific factors significantly influence customer satisfaction outcomes. Arizona's superior performance and Indiana's consistently lower scores suggest that successful operational practices can be identified, studied, and potentially replicated across the organization. The correlation between building age and customer satisfaction provides an additional lens through which to understand these regional differences, as facility modernization may represent a key factor in Arizona's success.

### Strategic Business Implications

These findings collectively suggest that customer satisfaction optimization requires a multi-dimensional approach addressing operational excellence, ownership structure considerations, geographic factors, and facility investment strategies. The strong ROI-customer satisfaction correlation indicates that investments in operational efficiency and revenue optimization generate measurable returns in customer experience quality. The moderate effect of ownership structure suggests that while corporate standardization provides advantages, the benefits are not overwhelming, indicating opportunities for franchise optimization through enhanced support and standardization protocols.

The regional variations revealed through the ANOVA analysis provide concrete targets for both improvement (Indiana) and best practice identification (Arizona). The significant state differences suggest that one-size-fits-all approaches may be suboptimal, supporting the development of region-specific strategies that account for local market conditions, demographics, and operational challenges.

### Practical Recommendations

Based on these statistical findings, several evidence-based recommendations emerge for organizational improvement (Zeithaml et al., 1996). First, the strong ROI-customer satisfaction correlation suggests that continued investment in operational excellence initiatives will generate measurable customer experience improvements (Anderson & Fornell, 2000). Second, Arizona's superior performance warrants detailed investigation to identify transferable best practices, particularly in areas such as staff training, inventory management, customer service protocols, and facility management (Heskett et al., 1994).

Third, Indiana's consistently poor performance across all comparative analyses indicates the need for immediate, comprehensive intervention. This should include management assessment, operational process review, staff development programs, and potentially facility improvements (Reichheld & Sasser, 1990). Fourth, the positive correlation between building age and customer satisfaction, combined with the negative ROI-building age relationship, suggests that strategic facility modernization investments could simultaneously improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency (Porter, 2008).

### Study Limitations and Future Research

While these analyses provide robust statistical evidence for business decision-making, several limitations should be acknowledged (Kirk, 2013). The cross-sectional design prevents causal inference, and the moderate effect sizes indicate that additional unmeasured variables likely influence customer satisfaction outcomes (Cohen, 1988). Future research should investigate specific operational practices that drive Arizona's superior performance, conduct longitudinal analyses to examine satisfaction trends over time, and explore additional variables such as staff training levels, inventory turnover rates, and local market competitive dynamics (Mittal & Kamakura, 2001).

## Conclusion

This comprehensive statistical analysis successfully identified significant relationships and differences in customer satisfaction across multiple operational and geographic dimensions within a large retail electronics chain. The three analytical approaches—independent samples t-tests, Pearson correlation analysis, and one-way ANOVA—converged to provide a robust evidence base for understanding customer satisfaction drivers and identifying strategic improvement opportunities.

The findings demonstrate that customer satisfaction in retail electronics is influenced by a complex interplay of operational performance, ownership structure, geographic factors, and facility characteristics (Zeithaml et al., 1996). The strong correlation between ROI performance and customer satisfaction (r = 0.637) establishes operational excellence as the primary driver of customer experience outcomes (Anderson & Fornell, 2000). The significant regional differences revealed through ANOVA analysis, particularly Arizona's superior performance and Indiana's consistently lower scores, provide concrete targets for best practice identification and improvement initiatives (Heskett et al., 1994).

These results support the thesis that statistical analysis reveals significant and actionable differences in customer satisfaction outcomes based on ownership structure and geographic location, while demonstrating meaningful correlations between operational metrics and customer experience quality (Homburg et al., 2017). The convergent findings across multiple analytical approaches strengthen confidence in the practical significance of these results for business decision-making (Kirk, 2013).

From a business intelligence perspective, these findings make intuitive sense and align with established principles of retail management and customer experience optimization (Porter, 2008). The positive relationship between operational efficiency and customer satisfaction reflects the fundamental business principle that well-run operations create better customer experiences (Reichheld & Sasser, 1990). The geographic variations suggest that local market factors, management quality, and operational execution vary across regions, which is consistent with the challenges of managing geographically distributed retail operations (Kaplan & Norton, 1996).

The moderate effect sizes observed across analyses indicate that while the identified factors are statistically significant and practically meaningful, customer satisfaction is influenced by multiple variables, many of which may not have been captured in this analysis. This finding suggests opportunities for future research to identify additional drivers of customer satisfaction and develop more comprehensive predictive models.

In conclusion, this statistical analysis provides a solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making and strategic planning within the retail electronics industry. The identification of specific geographic performance gaps, the quantification of operational excellence impacts, and the assessment of ownership structure effects collectively enable targeted interventions designed to optimize customer satisfaction outcomes across the organization's entire geographic footprint.
