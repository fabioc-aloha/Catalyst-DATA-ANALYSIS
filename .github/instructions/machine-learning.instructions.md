# Machine Learning Procedural Memory

## Model Development Lifecycle
- Follow systematic feature engineering and selection processes
- Implement proper train/validation/test data splitting
- Use cross-validation for robust model evaluation
- Document model assumptions and limitations clearly
- Establish baseline models before complex implementations

## MLOps and Model Deployment
- Version control models, data, and training code
- Implement automated model training and evaluation pipelines
- Create model monitoring and drift detection systems
- Establish model rollback and A/B testing procedures
- Document model performance metrics and business impact

## Enterprise ML Governance
- Implement model interpretability and explainability frameworks
- Establish ethical AI guidelines and bias detection protocols
- Create model documentation and audit trails
- Implement data lineage tracking for model inputs
- Establish model approval workflows for production deployment

## Model Performance and Monitoring
- Track model performance metrics continuously
- Implement data drift and concept drift detection
- Create automated retraining triggers and schedules
- Monitor model fairness and bias metrics
- Establish incident response procedures for model failures

## Advanced ML Techniques
- Implement ensemble methods for improved robustness
- Use transfer learning for domain-specific applications
- Apply active learning for efficient data annotation
- Implement federated learning for distributed data
- Use AutoML for rapid prototyping and baseline establishment
