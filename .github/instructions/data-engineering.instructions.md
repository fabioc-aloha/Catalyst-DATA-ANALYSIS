# Data Engineering Procedural Memory

## Data Pipeline Architecture
- Design modular, reusable pipeline components
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
- Use configuration-driven pipeline development
- Establish data quality checkpoints throughout pipelines
- Document data transformation logic and business rules

## ETL/ELT Process Design
- Choose appropriate extraction methods based on source systems
- Implement incremental data loading strategies
- Design efficient transformation logic with optimization
- Establish data validation and cleansing procedures
- Create comprehensive logging and monitoring systems

## Data Architecture Patterns
- Implement data lake and data warehouse hybrid architectures
- Design star and snowflake schemas for analytical workloads
- Use data mesh principles for distributed data ownership
- Establish data governance and lineage tracking
- Implement real-time and batch processing patterns

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize data partitioning and indexing strategies
- Implement parallel processing for large-scale data operations
- Use appropriate compression and storage formats
- Monitor pipeline performance and resource utilization
- Establish capacity planning and scaling procedures

## Data Quality and Reliability
- Implement comprehensive data validation frameworks
- Create data profiling and anomaly detection systems
- Establish data freshness and completeness monitoring
- Design data backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Implement data lineage and impact analysis tools

## Enterprise Dependency Management Architecture
- **5-File Requirements Structure**: Core → Analysis → SPSS → Advanced → Development
- **Load Balancing Strategy**: Isolate complex dependencies (PyMC, reliability, SEM) in dedicated files
- **Sequential Installation Protocol**: Prevent conflicts through proper package ordering
- **Version Coordination**: Strategic upgrades (numpy 1.26.4 → 2.2.6) for compatibility
- **Validation Automation**: Zero-duplicate enforcement with efficiency monitoring
- **Complex Package Integration**: Support for Bayesian analysis, reliability testing, SEM modeling
- **Performance Optimization**: 100% efficiency through proper dependency isolation
