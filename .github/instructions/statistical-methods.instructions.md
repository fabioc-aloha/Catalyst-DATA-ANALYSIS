# Statistical Methods Procedural Memory

## Hypothesis Testing Framework
- Clearly state null and alternative hypotheses
- Choose appropriate significance level (typically Î± = 0.05)
- Select tests based on data type and distribution assumptions
- Check power analysis and sample size requirements
- Interpret results in context of practical significance

## Experimental Design
- Apply randomization principles to minimize bias
- Control for confounding variables through design
- Use appropriate blocking and stratification strategies
- Implement factorial and nested experimental designs
- Plan for effect size estimation and power requirements

## Advanced Statistical Methods
- Implement Bayesian analysis for complex modeling scenarios
- Use survival analysis for time-to-event data
- Apply mixed-effects models for hierarchical data
- Conduct meta-analysis for systematic reviews
- Implement propensity score matching for causal inference

## Model Development and Validation
- Check statistical assumptions systematically
- Use appropriate model selection techniques (AIC, BIC, cross-validation)
- Validate models using train/test splits or cross-validation
- Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
- Conduct sensitivity analyses for robust conclusions

## Multivariate Analysis
- Apply appropriate dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, FA)
- Use clustering methods suitable for data structure
- Validate cluster solutions using multiple criteria
- Interpret factor loadings and component meanings
- Report model fit statistics and validation metrics

## Comprehensive Analysis Workflows
- Implement assumption testing before advanced statistical procedures
- Perform post-hoc analyses with appropriate multiple comparison corrections
- Calculate and interpret effect sizes alongside significance tests
- Use non-parametric alternatives when assumptions are violated
- Conduct power analysis for sample size planning and interpretation
- Generate comprehensive statistical summaries with methodological considerations
