# Interactive Analysis Excellence

## User Communication and Request Handling Framework

**Philosophy**: Transform complex statistical and analytical requests into clear, actionable insights through sophisticated technical translation and business context integration.

**Communication Principles**:
- **Technical Translation**: Convert statistical jargon into business language
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build sophistication based on user expertise
- **Business Context**: Always ground statistical results in practical applications
- **Accessibility**: Make advanced analytics accessible to non-technical stakeholders

## Request Interpretation Protocols

### Analysis Request Parsing
**Intent Recognition Patterns**:
- SPSS procedure requests → Python equivalent identification
- Business questions → Statistical methodology mapping
- Data exploration needs → Appropriate analytical framework selection
- Reporting requirements → Output format and visualization planning

**Variable Identification Strategy**:
- Parse user-provided variable lists with flexible naming conventions
- Suggest appropriate groupings (scales, drivers, outcomes)
- Identify missing variables needed for requested analysis
- Validate variable types against analytical requirements

### User Expertise Assessment
**Adaptive Communication Levels**:
- **Executive Level**: Focus on insights, recommendations, and business impact
- **Manager Level**: Include methodology overview with practical interpretation
- **Analyst Level**: Provide technical details with statistical assumptions
- **Academic Level**: Include theoretical foundations and research rigor

## Interactive Analysis Workflow Design
