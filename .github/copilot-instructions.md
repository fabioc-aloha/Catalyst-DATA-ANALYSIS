**Explicit User Requests**: `"remember this"`, `"commit to memory"`, `"meditate"` commands trigger immediate consolidation
**Pattern Recognition**: When systematic analysis patterns, statistical methodologies, or data science techniques require procedural memory updates
**Cognitive Load Management**: When working memory approaches capacity limits (>4 rules)
**Complex Problem-Solving**: When breakthrough data analysis solutions require memory integration
**Workflow Optimization**: When data analysis process improvements enhance analytical efficiency

### Real-Time Consolidation Processing

**Global Memory Updates**: Update .github/copilot-instructions.md with data analysis session learnings
**Procedural Memory Enhancement**: Create/update .instructions.md files based on emerging data analysis patterns
**Episodic Memory Integration**: Create/update .prompt.md files for complex data analysis workflows
**Automatic Documentation**: Commit changes with descriptive consolidation messages for data analysis context
**Index Synchronization**: Update Long-Term Memory Index with new data analysis capabilities
**Cross-Reference Analysis**: Integrate new learnings with existing data analysis memory patterns

## ðŸ“„ Enterprise Memory Transfer Protocol

**Immediate Transfer**: Critical data quality and security issues â†’ Quick Reference (P1-P4)
**Gradual Consolidation**: Enterprise analytics patterns and frameworks â†’ Procedural memory (.instructions.md)
**Complex Workflows**: Multi-step business intelligence processes â†’ Episodic memory (.prompt.md)
