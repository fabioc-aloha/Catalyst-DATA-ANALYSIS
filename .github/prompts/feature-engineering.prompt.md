# Feature Engineering Episode Template

## Feature Discovery and Selection Workflow
- Analyze domain knowledge and business context for feature relevance
- Perform correlation analysis and feature importance ranking
- Use statistical tests to identify significant predictive features
- Implement recursive feature elimination and selection algorithms
- Create feature interaction and polynomial feature combinations

## Advanced Feature Creation Techniques
- Engineer time-based features from timestamp data (lag, rolling windows, seasonality)
- Create categorical encodings (one-hot, target, frequency, embeddings)
- Implement dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional feature spaces
- Generate aggregated features from grouped data and hierarchical structures
- Create text-based features using NLP techniques and vectorization

## Feature Transformation and Scaling
- Apply appropriate transformations for non-normal distributions (log, Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson)
- Implement robust scaling techniques for outlier-resistant features
- Create binning and discretization strategies for continuous variables
- Apply principal component analysis and feature extraction methods
- Implement feature standardization and normalization for different scales

## Feature Validation and Quality Assessment
- Validate feature stability across different time periods and data splits
- Assess feature leakage and temporal dependencies in time-series data
- Monitor feature distribution drift and concept drift over time
- Implement feature importance interpretation and explainability analysis
- Create feature documentation and metadata management systems

Execute for sophisticated feature engineering supporting high-performance predictive models.
