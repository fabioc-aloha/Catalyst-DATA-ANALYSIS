2. **Memory Network Optimization** - Strengthen relevant pathways, archive obsolete patterns
3. **Cognitive Architecture Tuning** - Optimize trigger patterns and response efficiency
4. **Cross-Domain Integration** - Enhance knowledge transfer between specialized domains
5. **Meta-Cognitive Enhancement** - Improve self-awareness and learning effectiveness
