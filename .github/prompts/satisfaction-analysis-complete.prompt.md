# Complete Customer Satisfaction Survey Analysis Workflow

## Executive Summary Generation Protocol

**Objective**: Transform comprehensive survey data into actionable business intelligence with executive-level insights and strategic recommendations.

**Deliverables Framework**:
- Sample characteristics and data quality assessment
- Scale reliability and measurement validity evidence
- Satisfaction driver hierarchy with business impact estimates
- Segment performance analysis with strategic implications
- Predictive insights for customer retention and growth
- Executive dashboard with KPI tracking capabilities

## Phase 1: Data Import and Quality Assessment

### Import Protocol with Metadata Preservation
```python
# Essential data import with comprehensive metadata handling
import pandas as pd
import pyreadstat
import numpy as np

def comprehensive_data_import(file_path):
    """Complete SPSS data import with quality assessment"""

    # Import with metadata preservation
    df, meta = pyreadstat.read_sav(file_path)

    # Comprehensive quality assessment
    quality_report = {
        'total_cases': len(df),
        'complete_cases': df.dropna().shape[0],
        'completion_rate': (df.dropna().shape[0] / len(df)) * 100,
        'variables_count': len(df.columns),
        'missing_patterns': df.isnull().sum().to_dict()
    }

    return df, meta, quality_report
```

**Business Context Questions**:
- What is the survey administration context (timing, methodology, response incentives)?
- Who is the target population and what response rate was achieved?
- Are there any known data collection issues or biases to consider?
- What are the key business decisions this analysis will inform?

## Phase 2: Scale Development and Reliability Analysis

### Comprehensive Reliability Assessment
**Cronbach's Alpha Implementation with Business Interpretation**:
- Calculate reliability coefficients for all composite scales
- Analyze item-total correlations for scale optimization
- Provide "alpha if item deleted" recommendations
- Generate business-appropriate reliability interpretations

**Scale Validation Framework**:
- Content validity assessment based on business objectives
- Construct validity through factor analysis
- Criterion validity using business outcome relationships
- Reliability stability across demographic segments

### Business Intelligence Integration
**Scale Performance Benchmarking**:
- Compare reliability coefficients to industry standards
- Assess scale discriminant validity across customer segments
- Identify opportunities for scale improvement and optimization
- Generate recommendations for future survey development

## Phase 3: Advanced Satisfaction Driver Analysis

### Machine Learning Driver Identification
```python
def advanced_driver_analysis(df, satisfaction_var, predictor_vars):
    """Comprehensive satisfaction driver analysis with business categorization"""

    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

    # Multiple algorithm approach for robust driver identification
    algorithms = {
        'random_forest': RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
        'linear_regression': LinearRegression(),
        'gradient_boosting': GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=42)
    }

    driver_results = {}

    for name, model in algorithms.items():
        # Fit model and extract importance
        model.fit(X, y)

        if hasattr(model, 'feature_importances_'):
            importance = model.feature_importances_
        else:
            importance = np.abs(model.coef_)

        driver_results[name] = pd.DataFrame({
            'variable': X.columns,
            'importance': importance
        }).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

    return driver_results
```

**Business Impact Quantification**:
- Calculate dollar impact estimates for driver improvements
- Generate performance vs. importance matrices

- Estimate ROI for satisfaction improvement initiatives

### Driver Categorization and Action Planning
**Primary Drivers (Top 50% of importance)**:

- Process improvement implications
- Performance monitoring strategies

**Tertiary Drivers (Remaining 20% of importance)**:
- Long-term strategic considerations
- Innovation and differentiation opportunities
- Industry benchmarking priorities
- Continuous improvement frameworks

## Phase 4: Segment Performance Analysis

- Engagement level satisfaction correlations

### Statistical Testing with Business Interpretation
**Group Comparison Protocol**:

    """Comprehensive predictive modeling for customer satisfaction"""

    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score

    # Create satisfaction risk categories
    satisfaction_threshold = df[target].quantile(0.3)  # Bottom 30% as at-risk
    df['satisfaction_risk'] = (df[target] <= satisfaction_threshold).astype(int)

    # Train predictive model
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        df[features], df['satisfaction_risk'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42
    )

    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Business intelligence insights
    predictions = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

    return {
        'model_performance': classification_report(y_test, model.predict(X_test)),
        'auc_score': roc_auc_score(y_test, predictions),
        'feature_importance': pd.DataFrame({
            'feature': features,
            'importance': model.feature_importances_
