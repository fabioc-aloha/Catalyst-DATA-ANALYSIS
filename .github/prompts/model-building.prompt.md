# Model Building Episode Template

## Model Development Workflow
- Define clear business objectives and success metrics
- Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- Engineer features based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis
- Split data appropriately for training, validation, and testing
- Establish baseline models for performance comparison

## Model Selection and Training
- Compare multiple algorithms suitable for the problem type
- Implement proper cross-validation strategies
- Tune hyperparameters using systematic search methods
- Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
- Ensure reproducibility with proper random seed management

## Model Evaluation and Validation
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics for the business context
- Implement statistical significance testing for model comparison
- Assess model fairness and bias across different groups
- Validate model assumptions and check for violations
- Create comprehensive model documentation and interpretation

## Model Deployment Preparation
- Create model serialization and versioning procedures
- Implement model monitoring and drift detection systems
- Design A/B testing frameworks for model validation
- Establish rollback procedures for model failures
- Document model limitations and appropriate use cases

Execute for enterprise-grade predictive model development with full MLOps integration.
