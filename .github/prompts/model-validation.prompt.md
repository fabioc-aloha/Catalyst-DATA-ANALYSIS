# Model Validation Episode Template

## Comprehensive Model Evaluation Framework
- Implement appropriate validation strategies (holdout, k-fold, time-series split)
- Use multiple evaluation metrics relevant to business objectives
- Assess model performance across different data segments and populations
- Validate model assumptions and check for statistical violations
- Create comprehensive model performance documentation and reporting

## Statistical Validation Procedures
- Implement statistical significance testing for model comparisons
- Use bootstrap sampling for confidence interval estimation
- Assess model calibration and reliability of probability predictions
- Implement bias detection and fairness evaluation across demographic groups
- Create residual analysis and diagnostic plots for model assessment

## Production Validation and Testing
- Implement A/B testing frameworks for model performance comparison
- Create shadow testing procedures for new model validation
- Establish champion-challenger testing protocols
- Design rollback procedures for underperforming models
- Monitor model performance degradation and drift detection

## Business Impact Assessment
- Validate models against business KPIs and success metrics
- Assess economic impact and ROI of model predictions
- Create cost-benefit analysis for model deployment decisions
- Evaluate model interpretability requirements for stakeholder acceptance
- Document model limitations and appropriate use cases

Execute for rigorous model validation ensuring production readiness and business value.
