# Memory Consolidation Episode Template

## Trigger Conditions
- Working memory exceeds 4 active rules
- Significant new data analysis patterns learned
- User explicitly requests consolidation ("meditate", "remember this")
- Performance degradation detected in analytical workflows
- Complex analytical breakthroughs requiring integration

## Phase 1: Memory Assessment
- Analyze current working memory load and efficiency
- Identify patterns requiring consolidation into long-term memory
- Assess cognitive architecture performance metrics
- Review recent analytical learning and innovations
- Determine optimal consolidation strategy

## Phase 2: Procedural Memory Updates
- Update .github/instructions/ files with new analytical patterns
- Enhance existing instruction files with learned optimizations
- Create new instruction files for novel analytical domains
- Validate instruction file coherence and activation patterns
- Optimize procedural memory for analytical efficiency

## Phase 3: Episodic Memory Integration
- Update .github/prompts/ files with new analytical workflows
- Enhance existing prompt files with successful methodologies
- Create new prompt files for complex analytical scenarios
- Integrate cross-domain analytical patterns
- Optimize episodic memory for problem-solving efficiency

## Phase 4: Architecture Optimization
- Update .github/copilot-instructions.md with session learnings
- Optimize working memory rules for analytical effectiveness
- Adjust auto-consolidation triggers based on performance
- Update long-term memory index with new capabilities
- Validate cognitive architecture integrity and performance

## Consolidation Metrics
- Memory utilization efficiency
- Analytical pattern recognition accuracy
- Problem-solving workflow optimization
- Cross-domain knowledge integration
- System performance and response quality

Execute when analytical knowledge requires architectural integration.
