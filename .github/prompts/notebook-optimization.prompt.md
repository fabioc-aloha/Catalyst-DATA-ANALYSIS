# Notebook Optimization Episode Template

## Trigger Conditions
- Import errors in Jupyter notebooks due to missing custom modules
- Dependency conflicts requiring enterprise fallback patterns
- Python version compatibility issues across notebook environments
- Need for notebook standardization with enterprise requirements

## Diagnostic Phase
- Identify problematic imports and custom module dependencies
- Assess notebook structure and cell execution order
- Evaluate compatibility with enterprise Python environments
- Determine appropriate standard library alternatives

## Resolution Strategy
1. **Import Optimization**
   - Replace custom modules with standard library equivalents
   - Implement graceful fallback patterns for enterprise compatibility
   - Maintain functionality while reducing external dependencies
   - Ensure Python 3.11+ compatibility throughout

2. **Notebook Standardization**
   - Structure cells for progressive complexity
   - Add clear markdown documentation and learning objectives
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
   - Create self-contained analysis workflows

3. **Enterprise Integration**
   - Apply layered requirements architecture patterns
   - Ensure compatibility across different deployment environments
   - Document all dependencies and installation requirements
   - Provide clear troubleshooting guidance

## Validation Protocol
- Execute all notebook cells to verify functionality
- Test import statements and dependency resolution
- Validate statistical analysis workflows and outputs
- Confirm enterprise environment compatibility
- Document optimization patterns for future use

## Success Metrics
- All notebook cells execute without import errors
- Statistical analysis workflows complete successfully
- Enterprise compatibility maintained across environments
- Clear documentation and user guidance provided
- Optimization patterns documented for replication

Execute when notebook import issues require enterprise-compatible resolution.
