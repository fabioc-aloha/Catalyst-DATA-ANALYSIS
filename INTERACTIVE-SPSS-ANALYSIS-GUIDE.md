### Request Interpretation
Add: *"Please include business interpretation and recommendations, not just statistical results"*

### Ask for Comparisons
Include: *"Compare these results to typical satisfaction survey benchmarks"*

### Request Visualizations
Add: *"Include publication-ready charts and graphs for executive presentation"*
